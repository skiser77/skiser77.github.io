        <p>
            We are The Sensational Kangaroo, a hammock company based in Northern Aulstralia.
            Our hammocks are the most comfortable hammocks in the world. They 
            supposedly feel like you are inside of a kangaroos pouch. We even
            interviewed a joey to get a first hand account that it feels like the 
            inside of a kangaroos pouch. Our product is made up of the highest quality
            of kangaroo fur. We get off a kangaroo farm in Northern, Australia 
            where we feed them fresh never frozen ground beef. Don't worry we don't 
            harm the kangaroos at all. Six months we sheer our kangaroos and we make
            sure we do it in a manner that do not bother the kangaroos.

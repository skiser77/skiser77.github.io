            <h3>Good Website</h3>
            <a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>
            <p>
                Although Craigslist is a very simple looking website it does its job very well. This website
                is used by users to publicly buy and sell items. Most of the website is clickable links that allow users
                to do different things. Users can post ads, learn about Craigslist, find jobs, search for specific items, learn how 
                to void scams, change languages, and so much more. This website does a very good job of categorizing
                information making it easy for users find what they need to do.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Contrast- Craigslist is notorious for being just a blank white background with most of the
                    text being blue clickable links. Although this is very simple it does a very good job of providing contrast.
                    Categories are bolded and the weight is heavier making them jump out. The background of the three different boxes 
                    are grey and white making it easy to see which information is grouped together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alignment- Craigslist does a very good job of aligning information. On the left side there is a box that
                    conatains a search bar, an event calander, and links that help with usabliity. In the middle there is a big box that
                    contains most of the services that Craiglist provides. This is where the user will find items for sale, services, 
                    discussion forumns, and other useful links. On the far right there is a box that is strictly for changing language 
                    and changing location. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repetition- Craigslist does an overwhelmingly ammount of repition. The main thing that Crailist does is the repition 
                    of blue clickable links. Almost every single clickable link on the page is the default blue and underlined. This is done 
                    intentionally and not out of laziness. Other repition includes the craiglist logo and the icon to post an add. When it comes 
                    to repition of icons Craislist is a little bit lacking. I think that this is done out of simplicity. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Proximity- Craislists does a very good job of organizing its information. There are three disinct boxes that are are 
                    made distinct using grey and white. Each box has different headers that are bolded and made larger to show what type of 
                    information is below it.

            <h3>Bad Website</h3>
            <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a>
            <p>
                This website is the home page for the Yale School of Art. This page is still in use as of 2024. The website is used 
                to learn about the school, apply to the school, find current events, view the schools calandar, and other things. This 
                website is not good and especially for an Ivy League College there is a lot wrong with this website. It is very ironic 
                that the webpage of an art school looks this bad. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Contrast- I will say that this website definetly has contrast. There are a lot of different colors being used and
                    a ton of different font weights being used. But the contrast is not being used well. First off the colors do not work 
                    well together. The yellow, orange, and neon green do not look good together. Also I do not understand why 
                    some of the boxes background is this weird gradient. It doesn't look good and doesn't do anything for the contrast.
                    The header and footer is white text that is highlighted black. Also the weight of the headers are out of order.
                    At the top there is a really large header. Then there is a smaller header below that. And below that is another larger 
                    header. Also the background picture of this website is horrible. It makes it hard to see the information and also what 
                    is the point of the image?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alignment- I think the worst part about this website is probably its alignment. All of the information 
                    on this page is to the very far left. And then there is just blank space on the far right of the page. The balance 
                    of this webpage is just horrible and there is too much white space. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repetition- There is little to no repition on this webpage. The first header is black text that is highlighted yellow. Then 
                    the next header is black text that is highlighted white. Some of the information is in yellow boxes, orange boxes, or green boxes. 
                    The clickable links throughout the webpage are different colors making it hard to see what links are actually clickable. I will 
                    say that at least the website uses a repeition to divide information. Each section is divided by this ugly black bar. The header and footer 
                    are also using the same uinappealing white text that is highlighted black.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Proximity- This website does not use proximity well. It is hard to see what information goes with what. There are multiple headers 
                    that are repeated throughout the page as well as headers being the wrong size throughout. Also some information just dont have headers 
                    at all so it is hard to tell what the purpose of it is. Also all of the information has different spacing making it very hard to read.

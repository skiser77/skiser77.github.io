        <h3>History of Skyrise</h3>
        <p>
            Skyrise started off as a ragtag team that was known to not take the sport seriously and be toxic.
            In 2019 Skyrise did not qualify for regionals but the following year Skyrise managed to just barely 
            barely qualify for regionals. In the 2023 season a new team emerged. Skyrise was a reformed team team 
            that cared about the sport. That year the team made a very good run at nationals. This year the team is 
            on pace to go to nationals.

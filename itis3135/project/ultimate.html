        <h2>About Ultimate Frisbee</h2>
        <h3>How do you play ultimate frisbee?</h3>
        <p>
            Ultimate frisbee is played on a 40 x 120 yard field. The length of the field is divided into each end zone being 25 yards and 
            the length of the field is 70 yards. Each team will have 7 players on a field at a time. The goal of the sport is to pass
            the disc to anther player in the endzone. Players cannot move with the disc in their hands so in order to progress the 
            disc they must pass it. A player may hold on to the disc for up to 10 seconds. If it is not thrown it is a turn over.
            The sport is self refereed meaning fouls, outs, and goals are all called by players on the field. 
        </p>
        <h3>How is competitive frisbee typically played?</h3>
        <p>
            When people think about ultimate frisbee they generally think about running all around the field trying to get the disc
            but there is actually a strategy in comptitive ultimate. The most basic offense will generally be ran in what is called a 
            vertical stack. There are 2 handlers who handle the disc and 5 cutters who line up vertically and make cuts to try and 
            get the disc. The most basic defense is man defense where defenders will match up with other players and defend them man to man.
